A new and official meteor package for material now exists. meteor add angular:angular-material

Intro
---

This package provides an easy way to implement [Google Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)
components in your Meteor apps which utilize Angular.

This is simply a wrapper around [Angular Material Design](https://material.angularjs.org/#/) and will work with   the excellent [Package by Urigo](http://angularjs.meteor.com/) which provides Angular functionality to meteor.

I take no credit in any of the fine work that went into this project.

I have updated to use the current stable 0.8.3 version.  

Use
---

Add the package with meteor add ashkettle:ngmaterial

Add a reference to the library in your module angular.module('blog',['angular-meteor','ngMaterial']);

Start using it according to the [Instructions](https://material.angularjs.org/#/)
